Add a new Next.js App Router page to this project.

First read the existing pages (packages/web/src/app/) to understand the routing structure, layouts, and patterns used.

Create a complete page for: $ARGUMENTS

Requirements:
- Place in the correct location under app/ following Next.js 14 App Router conventions
- Use server components by default, add 'use client' only where necessary
- Include proper TypeScript types
- Match the existing dark theme and design system
- Add metadata export with title and description
- Include loading.tsx and error.tsx if the page fetches data
- Wire up to any existing auth (Clerk) or data fetching patterns already in the project
- Make it fully responsive

Show the user the URL path it will be accessible at when done.
