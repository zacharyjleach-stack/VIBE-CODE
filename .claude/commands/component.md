Create a new React component for this project.

Read the existing components in the codebase to understand the patterns, styling conventions, and structure being used (check src/components/ or packages/web/src/components/).

Then create a polished, production-quality component based on: $ARGUMENTS

Requirements:
- Match the existing dark theme and CSS variables (--accent, --bg-dark, --text, etc.)
- Use TypeScript with proper interfaces for all props
- Use the same styling approach as existing components (Tailwind, CSS modules, or inline styles - match what's already there)
- Add hover states, transitions, and animations where appropriate
- Make it fully responsive (mobile-first)
- Export as named export
- No placeholder content - make it real and complete

After creating the file, show the import statement the user needs to add it to their page.
